# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
    Pretty confident. It's similar to things I was doing in C#, so I think I have some experience.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
    Same as above, really. I know how and when to use ands and ors.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
    Broken record. I have experience with them. Not typing out else in elsif is kind of messing with me, but I think I'm getting used to it.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
    Much longer than I thought. Approximately 2.5 hours. I wanted to be finishing the arrays assignment by now.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    Better memorize the terms. Find myself not as confident on what type or operator term to use.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    Wondering if we'll get more tutorials on different methods to interact with variables. If not, I'll need to study upc on that too.
